### Description

Adding fully automated highway building as plugin to Lambda.
The tool places building material and destroys wrong blocks in high frequency using well-timed packets.
The module can build autonomously in all 8 directions while the pathfinder keeps the desired position and takes care of any possible dangerous situations like liquids or gaps.
Advanced inventory management allows the bot to fully utilize materials stocked in shulker boxes or in the ender chest.
It is highly customizable and allows deep changes in system using configurations.
It is fully compatible with most modules of Lambda like `LagNotifier`, `AutoEat` etc and also is confirmed to work with `Rusherhack`, `Future`, `Impact` etc.

### Installation
1. Get the latest Lambda release here https://github.com/lambda-client/lambda/releases
2. Open Lambda menu in main menu to open plugin settings
3. Press `Open Plugin Folder`
4. Move plugin `HighwayTools-*.jar` into the folder `.minecraft/lambda/plugins`

### Known issues
- `AutoLog` is not compatible with `AutoReconnect`

### Troubleshooting
- Deactivate `AntiHunger` for faster block breaking because it makes you basically float.
- If stuck check, if AutoCenter is on `MOTION` to get moved to middle of the block (Baritone can't move exactly to block center)
- If placed block disappear increase the `TickDelayPlace` until it works
- Deactivate `IllegalPlacements` if the server requires (like 2b2t)
- Reset stash position if the bot keeps going to 0, 0
